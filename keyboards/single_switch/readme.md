# single_switch

The `single_switch` layout is designed for a single switch keyboard. 
My intended purpose is for a single Novel Keys x Kailh Big Switch Series.

Keyboard Maintainer: [trblae](https://github.com/trblae)  
Hardware Supported: Pro Micro

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make single_switch:default
